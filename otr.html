      <h1>Open Technology Radio</h1>
      <p>Open Technology Radio (OTR) is an open source online radio station. This project was started to experiment with PiFm, a piece of software that allows users to broadcast a low powered radio signal from a Raspberry Pi's GPIO. However, the project turned into a type of online radio station where users could upload their own radio shows to be broadcasted through the website. OTR is not currently hosted on this website, though you are free to download the source code from <a href="http://www.github.com/TristanDamron/OTR">GitHub</a> and launch your own OTR! Happy broadcasting!</p>
