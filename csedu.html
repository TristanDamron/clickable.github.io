    <h1>Computer Science Education</h1>
    <p>I believe that computer science education is the most important and basic right for all students in the American public education system. In a world built on the foundations of technologies past, it seems only appropriate that the scholar of tomorrow understand the fundamentals of technology and computer systems.</p>
    <p>Good computer science education should follow these guidelines:</p>
    <li>Allow Alternatives for Students</li>
    <li>Don't Alienate the Students</li>
    <li>Give Purpose and Provide Inspiration</li>
 <p>In conclusion...</p>
 <h2>Inspire to create; Don't create in hopes of inspiring.</h2>
 <p>Computer science is a great field to be in because it involves creativity and problem solving. Letting students discover problems and figure them out on their own is the best way for them to learn.</p>
